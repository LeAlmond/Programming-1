# Lab 1

In lab 1 we covered the basic's of doing math in C. This consisted of some basic addition, subtraction, division and multiplications. The restrictions whilst doing this lab were as listed below

 * No And
 * No Or
 * No NotEqual

#### Excercise 1

 > Write a program that:

 (1) asks the user for a temperature value
 (2) displays that value, 30 and 13.89

#### Excercise 2

 > Write a program that:

 (1) lets j = 45.10
 (2) asks the user for a number g
 (2) increases j by 10.00% if the g is 3. If the g is not 3, then j is to be decreased by 10%
 (3) displays j

#### Excercise 3

> Allow a user to enter a value as GCT and a item price, then calculate the total GCT and Total Price of the item.

#### Excercise 4

> Write a program that:

(1) asks the user for three body weights
(2) places the sum of last two weights into k
(3) decreases k by the first weight
(4) displays all three weights and k

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
        float w1, w2, w3, k;

        printf("Enter the first weight\n");
        scanf("%f", &w1);

        printf("Enter the secong weight\n");
        scanf("%f",&w2);

        printf("Enter the third weight\n");
        scanf("%f",&w3);

        k = (w2 + w3) - w1;

        printf("\nFirst weight: %.2f\nSecond weight: %.2f\nThird weight: %.2f\nk = %.2f", w1, w2, w3, k);

        return 0;

}
```

#### Excercise 5

> Write a program that:

(1) lets m = 40
(2) asks the user for two ages
(3) increases m by the first age only if the second is lower than the first
(4) displays m

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
        int m, a1, a2;
        m = 40;

        printf("Enter the first age\n");
        scanf("%d", &a1);

        printf("Enter the second age\n");
        scanf("%d", &a2);

        if(a1 > a2) {
                m = m + a1;
        }

        printf("\nM = %d", m);

        return 0;
}
```
