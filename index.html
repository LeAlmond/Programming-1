> This is a question

Code in this section will be presented by way of code blocks such as this question from lab # 1.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
       float y, x;
       x = 1;
       y = 1;

       printf("%s","Enter GCT Percent ");
       scanf("%f\n",&x);

       printf("%s","Enter a Price ");
       scanf("%f\n",&y);

       x= (y * (x/100));
       y= (y + x);

       printf("%s %.2f\n","Total GCT is $", x);
       printf("%s %.2f\n","Your Total is $", y);

       return 0;
}
```
