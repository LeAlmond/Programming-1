## Welcome to The Programming 1 Lab Repository

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/LeAlmond/Programming-1/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Lab 2

In lab 2 we focused mainly on comparing values to other values and returning a variety of other values

```markdown
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
        int m = 40,  n = 10, v1 = 13, v2 =67;
        int n1, n2, n3;

        printf("%s","Enter the first Number ");
        scanf("%i",&n1);

        printf("%s","Enter the second Number ");
        scanf("%i",&n2);

        printf("%s","Enter the third Number ");
        scanf("%i",&n3);

        if (n1 + n2 == v1)
        {
                if (n3 <= v2)
                {
                        m = m - n;
                }

        }

        printf("%i\n",m);

        return 0;
}
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/LeAlmond/Programming-1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
