The Program created was designed to

	1. Create and add Patients to a file
	2. Create and add Rooms to a file
	3. Edit Patients from the previously created patient file
	4. Automatically admit, discharge and assign patients to a room
	5. Create a file with a report showing the ages of patients admitted
	6. Create a file with a report showing the condition of patients admitted
	7. Create a file with the current addmited patients, relevant information and there current room

There are a few main constants defined at the start of the code.

	#define MAXPATIENT 35 
		// constant to define max amount of patients
	#define MAXROOM 21 
		// constant to define max amount of rooms

	#define PATIENT_EX "%-8d%-13s%-13s%-10s%-5d%-12s\n" 
		// the format to export the patient struct
	#define PATIENT_IN "%d %s %s %s %d %s" 
		// the format to accept the patient struct

	#define ROOM_EX "\n%-4d%-11s%-5d%-7s%" 
		// the format to export the room struct excluding patient id's
	#define ROOM_IN "%d% s% d% s%" 
		// the format to accept the room struct excluding patient id's

There are two main structs defined at the start of the code as well


//The Patient Structure which stores the following

struct pstruct {
        int id; //The ID Number
        char fname[12]; //The First Name
        char lname[12]; //The Last Name
        int birth; //The Date of Birth
        char condition[9]; //The Covid Condition
        char status[10]; //The Admitance Status
} pstruct;

//The Room Structure which stores the following

struct rstruct {
        int id; //The room ID Number
        char respirator[12]; //Respirator Status
        int patients; //Amount of beds
        char staff[12]; //Type of Staff assigned
        int patientid[5]; //Array for patient ID Number's
} rstruct;
